This repository demonstrates a common bug in React's `useEffect` hook: forgetting to include state variables in the dependency array.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, resulting in an infinite loop due to the missing dependency. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version. This highlights the importance of carefully managing dependencies within `useEffect` to avoid unexpected behavior and performance issues.
